<p>An eight day forecast of available water depths for the Fraser River South Arm Navigation Channel; the weekly report is published every Friday for the coming week.  The calculated water depths are displayed in a time-series graph for the selected period; the forecasts are generated by the Canadian Coast Guard, Western Region using the computer program AVADEPTH.

<h3 class="h5"><a href="/avdpth_srch-eng.html?page=pwl">Predicted Water Levels & Velocities</a></h3>
<p>Displays predicted water levels and velocities every two kilometres along the Fraser River in a tabular format.  User defined variables are selected from the Parameters drop-down menu.</p>
<p>These are pre-generated water levels and velocities from a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model; that was employed as a general predictive tool for assessing hydrodynamic conditions on the river.  By assigning tidal elevations at the Strait of Georgia, and river discharges upstream, a water level and average current can be computed for each cross section defined in the model domain.  The model computations were on a 10 minute time interval and simulated nine different river flow / discharge scenarios.</p>
<p>The selected approach utilized a combinationw of 1-D and 2-D numerical models of the river in order to optimize model performance.  The water level data that was generated by the 1-D model was subsequently utilized to define the upstream boundary conditions in the 2-D model runs for the "Animated Currents".</p>

<h3 class="h5"><a href="/avdpth_srch-eng.html?page=acv">Animated Currents</a></h3>
<p>Displays animated currents within predefined reaches of the Fraser - South Arm Channel.  User defined variables are selected from the Parameters drop-down menu.</p>
<p>These are pre-generated currents from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model which represents a depth average flow condition through the water column at a pre-defined location; allowing the user to assess if flow conditions are either strong, moderate, or weak and in which direction.</p>
<p>Users need to be aware that during periods of low river flow, fresh water may flow over the salt water at depth and create stratified conditions; for this reason, when comparing predicted values to either the surface currents or the currents at depth there may be some significant differences.  Comparisons of the model results to an acoustic current metre located at Annieville Channel showed a general accuracy of +/- 10%.</p>
<p>It should be noted that large, deep vessels navigating the river channel experience currents throughout much of the water column and, as such, depth-averaged currents should provide a reasonable indication of overall current-induced effects on the vessel.</p>
